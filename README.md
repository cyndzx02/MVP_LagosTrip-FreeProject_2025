# AgroNova
This project answers a real problem.
Which is: How do we access local product in our towns?
How do our cultivators make the population access fresh products?
AgroNova helps us access local and organic product through a platform.

Context
=======
Agriculture is a key sector of the economy, yet many 
farmers face challenges in selling their products efficiently. 
Lack of visibility, inventory management complexity, and dependency
on intermediaries reduce their profit margins.

At the same time, consumers increasingly seek fresh, 
local agricultural products but struggle to find accessible
short supply chains. AgroNova aims to address these issues
by creating a digital platform that directly connects producers with consumers.
